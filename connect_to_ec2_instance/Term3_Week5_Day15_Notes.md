# EC2 creation for POSTGRES SQL

Very brief overview for creating an EC2 instance and connecting remotely through Python scripts. This is the set up configuration only at a very base level without taking into consideration neccesary security steps in limiting IP access etc etc.

## Create EC2 instance

```
sudo ssh -i /home/mrixon95/.ssh/Term3Day7KeyPair.pem ubuntu@54.237.100.36
```
